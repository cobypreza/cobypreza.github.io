## Why Software Engineering?
My interest in software engineering stems from problem-solving. Everyone has problems, and everyone wants a solution. Software engineers help make the solutions to many problems by designing systems that make tasks both easier, faster, and reliable. Many applications people depend on daily such as tools for communication, healthcare systems, and banking are made by software engineers. I have always wanted to make a big impact in some sort of way and software engineering allows me to do that behind the scenes. 

## What's There To Learn?
There is everythign to learn when it comes to software engineering. That in itself makes it such an interesting field to dive into. Once you think you have a grasp, there is always another problem, bug, method, that you've never seen before. Software engineering requires adaptability, as solutions that might work in one situation may not work in another. This continuous cycle of learning prevents the the field from feeling stale and should encourage both growth and curiosity within engineers.

I would like to be proficient with programming languages based on what's used in the current industry. Luckily, I know that JavaScript is a big part of this program's curriculum, and experience with this will help me for later. I would also like to learn more about databases and the usage of SQL. I know that's very important in regards to storing and retrieving data and data has it's place in a lot of important algorithms, but that's just about it. I'm sure there are much more skills that I would gather on my journey in this class.

## More To Explore!

In the future. like to learn how to make algorithms on my own without the usage of artifical intelligence and having it do all the work for me. There are a lot of things that I would like to create, maybe even some business ideas I could have as a side hustle in the future. Knowing how to even begin would be a big plus for me. There are also a lot of tools that me, as someone who is interest in cybersecurity, would be useful to know how to create. I would also like to work with other engineers and build collaboration and professional skills. Rarely in the industry will you face a problem alone. Knowing how to work well with others is a fundamental skill that everyone should try to achieve.
