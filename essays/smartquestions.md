## What Qualifies As A Smart Question?
One of the qualities of a smart question is to show that there was prior research done beforehand. Before asking someone a question, save both of your times and search it up first. Search the archives of the forums, search the Web, read a manual, ask a friend. Any credible and reliable source can do. If you happen to find the answer right off the bat, then it probably wasn't a smart question. Having done your research beforehand displays a deeper understanding of the topic. By asking a smart question, your prior research demonstrates both background knowledge and willingness to learn. 

Another quality of a smart question is writing the question in a clear and precise manner. If you write your question in such way, then you may also get a clear and precise answer, which is the ultimate goal. You can do so by spelling, punctuating, and capitalizing correctly. Also use proper vocabulary as to show your professionalism. Also be informative about the problem presented. Describe symptoms, bugs, environment, your prior research, diagnostic steps, any other useful information that can be given to the reader. The more background information you give, the better someone may be able to reproduce such problem and fix it on their own.

## Smart Question!

Here is what I consider a smart question: "Can you tell me why I get Character set Mismatch in the first insert even if "in theory" they are equivalent?". So there's a lot to unpack here. The first thing that caught my eye about this question is their mention of theory. This shows that they understand the model to a certain extent. It also shows that they have done their prior research and has the ability to self-diagnose their code. This question also goes beyond asking "why doesn't this work" rather they ask for an explanation as to why their algorithm does not match with their expectations. They also present a code from when their algorithm worked and when their algorithm didn't work. They also ask smaller sub-problems such as "what are the most likely reasons ___" and "are there any known differences ___" as an attempt to reach a deeper understanding. An important note to make about this forum and this question is that they also present their whole program as to help others recreate the problem on their own computers.

In a responder's answer to the original poster's problem, they were able to recreate the problem on their own device due to the original poster's inclusion of code. The answerer explained the issue and even presented their own changes to the original poster's code. They also explained their answer in accordance to the theory the original poster was questioning.

## Not Smart Question!

Here is what I consider a not so smart question: "how do i call on a specific key from a list of dictionaries in python ?". First of all, there is no capitalization and there is also a space between the last word and the question mark. I will admit this is a little nitpicky, and it is also very possible that the poster is not from the United States of America. Though, Raymond also said that is good practice to clarify that English is not their native language in their inquiry.

This question was actually not answered by another user. Rather it was closed, by who I'm guessing is a site admin. This site admin also gave reference questions that the user could have searched up prior to asking the question. It seems as if others have asked this same type of question beforehand, got their answer, and is archived. This previous thread was also not hard to find as the question this poster asked is very similar to the archived post. This shows a lack of research was done before asking the question and could have saved both themselves and the admin time.
