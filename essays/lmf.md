## First Impressions
I still consider myself new in all things computer science, but one thing I will say is that I have heard of most of the languages. TypeScript on the other hand, has flown right past my radar some how. Though, after spending some time with it and learning about it, I think that it's honestly one of my favorite languages. I mean I've tried C, C++, Java, and Python but something about TypeScript stands out to me. Maybe it was the background in all those languages, but learning this language was definitely the easiest in my opinion.

For example, in comparison to Java it took me a particularly long time to get used to. TypeScript felt a lot less demanding in syntax and its code in comparison. Java at the start demands types, classes, and structures while TypeScript lets you be a lot more fluid and, thought it's safer to, doesn't need a declaration of type to work. Also with TypeScript, it felt a lot easier to transfer my thoughts into code.

## Ups and Downs?
I already expressed a lot of my feelings about this question beforehand, but I will say that I think that the language is good. Like I said before, TypeScript does not demand on type inference. This flexibility allows for a lot of time to be saved as it gives us one less thing to worry about. Also it makes the code more readable for the regular person. Types, as it did for me, made learning how to program a hastle. Types in Java, the first language introduced in ICS 111, are very strict and the terminal, or IDE, is very quick to let you know that. 

Though this flexibility is great, it allows for comfortability. Starting on TypeScript without learning the value types hold in a program is a huge caveat in my opinion. I am very grateful for my foundation to be built in Java even if the learning curve was harsh. In bigger programs, types are an absolute necessity. That is, unless you want a messy and hard to debug program.

## WOD am I doing here?
In ICS 314(Software Engineering), we are introduced to Workout of the Day, or WOD for short. This is where we are given a little background information, a prompt, and are asked to code something that would solve a problem. I believe that WODs are extremely useful in the teaching of a language. Going into class on the day of a WOD is very nerve-racking, but that pressure is key to taking it to the next level, in my opinion. It simulates a realistic situation whether you got an upcoming deadline, or even more close to home, a technical interview. Even though these WODs scare me, I will say that the satisfaction of having solved the problem before the blaring alarm sounds is tough to beat. I am both excited and scared for the ones to come.
